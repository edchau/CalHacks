# Mood Up!
## About

MoodUp is a chatbot that is there for you in your times of struggle. It takes into account how you're feeling and gives you a response based on the current mood of your message or certain areas of problems such as relationships, schools, and more! With the dynamism and stresses of everyday life, we wanted to make a utility to help people calm down when faced with hardships. If the bot senses that people are sad, it will send a cute animal picture to the user and also give advice on specific situations. Mental health is a crucial part in people's lives and it needs to be kept in check. MoodUp is a great tool to help people remain relaxed and lower stress. With the many situations encoded into our chatbot, MoodUp is able to reply to people with great advice catered to their individual situations. Following the end of the campaign, we plan on building upon this project by optimizing artificial intelligence to consider a more vast area of situations and also learn from user inputs. We also want to help people manage their daily lives better by providing analytics of how often people feel a certain emotion and what they can do better to keep a healthy mind.

## How to Run

run: `python3 bot.py`. The bot will appear on our discord channel: https://discord.gg/gMfc6tS

Then, the user can input phrases such as "I am very excited today" or "My girlfriend broke up with me" in order to trigger responses from the discord chat bot. Additionally, the chatbot currently has a feature where we can classify images (only based on url for now), which may be used later to classify faces during a video chat on discord. We also have a tool to capture analytics but could not get that fully working.
